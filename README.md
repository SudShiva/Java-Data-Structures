# Java Data Structures - Daily Learning

Welcome to the Java Data Structures repository! This repository is designed to record my learning and understand various data structures implemented in Java. ibelieve in the power of daily learning, so I will try to  update this repository regularly.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource of my  learning and implementing data structures in Java. Each data structure is organized in its own directory, containing the Java source code, example usage, and explanatory comments. We can explore each data structure individually to understand their implementation and usage.

## Data Structures

Currently, the repository covers the following data structures:

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Tree (Binary, AVL, Red-Black)
6. Heap
7. Hash Table
8. Graph
9. Trie
10. and more...

I will continuously update the repository with new data structures and related algorithms. Each data structure directory includes a dedicated README file explaining the concepts, complexity analysis, and example usage, for my learning.
